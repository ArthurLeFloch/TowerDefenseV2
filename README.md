# TowerDefenseV2
Tower Defense V2 is a tile-based tower defense game, where enemies spawn from multiple tiles and have to reach the end tile.

The tilemap is designed using _perlin noise_, as well as the obstacles.

Towers are placed directly on the grid (and enemies can't go through). Then, enemies find the shortest path to reach the end.

## Waves
As the number of passed waves increase, the initial life of the enemies is increased.

## Player level
As the player level goes up, you can buy new towers and unlock new tower levels.
